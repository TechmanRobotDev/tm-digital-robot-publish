# TM Digital Robot Extension [tmrobot.digital_robot]

TM Digital Robot Extension is a simulation tool that enables developers to control virtual robots using TMSimulation(TMflow). It simplifies robot motion and vision application learning in Isaac Sim's virtual environment, eliminating the need for a physical robot. Pre-built Motion and Vision interfaces handle complex communication between TMRobot and Isaac Sim, streamlining integration tasks.
