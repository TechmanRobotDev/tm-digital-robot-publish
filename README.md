## TM Digital Robot Extension for NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim

## Introduction

**_Important:_** This extension is in **beta testing** and **not for production use**.

TM Digital Robot Extension is a simulation tool that enables developers to control virtual robots using TMSimulation(TMflow). It simplifies robot motion and vision application learning in Isaac Sim's virtual environment, eliminating the need for a physical robot. Pre-built Motion and Vision interfaces handle complex communication between TMRobot and Isaac Sim, streamlining integration tasks.

## Release Notes

Refer to the [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for details.

## Development Prerequisites

-   Basic knowledge of **TMflow programming**.
-   Basic experience of **Python programming**.
-   Familiarity with **Isaac Sim** – it’s helpful to go through the [tutorials](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/introductory_tutorials/tutorial_intro_interface.html) before using the TM Digital Robot Extension.

## Setup Prerequisites

-   TM Simulator(TMflow) 2.22 installed on Windows 10
-   Python 3.10 installed on the PC running Isaac Sim
-   Visual Studio Code and Git installed on the PC running Isaac Sim
-   Ensure the PC running Isaac Sim and TM Simulator are on the same network and using a **wired connection**. A wireless connection is not recommended due to potential instability and delays.

**Notes**:

-   TM Simulator runs on Windows 10 only
-   Isaac Sim runs on Windows or ubuntu, and requires a GPU. Ensure your system meets the [Hardware Requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html#system-requirements), the level of "Good" is highly recommended.
