## Types of Cache Services in Omniverse

There are two types of Cache services available in Omniverse:

### 1. [Cache on Workstation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/utilities/latest/cache/workstation.html)

This method requires installing Cache via the Omniverse Launcher. You should find it displayed as shown below:
